Attend ItNothing more easier than that!!By Aditya Grover(SSCBS,DU)Problem Scenario-There are thousands of Attendance Taking and Management systems prevailing in India,we have not been able to make a system that can bewidely used and accepted because of lack of its feasibility somewhere or else. For eg-the biometric systems involves the cost and data entry related problems, the online attendance system involves the connectivity issues,the facial recognition through AI is stillat a developing stage, and will come at very high costand many similar problems.That’s the reason that even today, we take attendance through roll callsin most of the colleges of the Best universities of India-Delhi University. Problem Statement-In the time where all of us have mobile phones in hand, marking attendance needs not be a matter of page and paper.On an average, a takes 3 minutes to mark the students through roll calls, multiply it by number of periods, then by days, you will arrive toa big figure. Then, giving monthly attendance reports, problems related to waivers and manual framework are some of the problems that teachers usually face.Then, prevailing ambiguity, keeping their own record on separate mobile applications and a lotsof time wastage is something what all the students actually face.How does it work?So this attendance management system works on 3 basic pillars-1.Creating rooms using LAN WIFIHere, all the mobile phones are connected to the wifi of the respective college, with the mobile application open. The teacher will be the host of the LAN wifijust on simple click in the mobile application.2. Random Code GenerationHere, a random number getsgenerated through the host’s interface(teachers interface)say, numbersthree is selected from one to sixboxes visible on screen of teacher and student, so the students will be required to press the same number on their mobile phones to get themselves marked3.Fingerprint Verificaiton-Around 95% of smartphones used by DU students  either have fingerprint sensors or facial recognition function. This step will ensure that genuine attendance is only marked. There will be situations where the above verification could not be made, then the user interface of the teacher will be easy and smoothenough that just on double tab, the attendance would be marked for the concerned personas will be shown in the prototype in the PPT of 2ndround.Revenue ModalThere are actually many ways in which this application can be made a profitable one.1. College Subscription Model-here the college can be made convinced to adopt the ‘Attend It’ systems in its college and we can charge subscription fee from the College2. Teacher-Student Subscription Model-Here the individual teacher pays for having her personal manager to manage herattendancetaking system that takes the attendance and generates daily, weeklyand monthly reports and analysis. Even students can be charged as one time installation fee say only Rs 20 or so, as its actuallyreducing their need to maintain the record of their attendance somewhere else.3..Advertisement based revenue Model-though this will be given the last priority till we actually are successful in establishing our model because a advertisement as revenue is not a very good option, though our users actually belong to age group of 18-26 years.So it’s a time to say a permanent good bye to the roll calls and save time, money, paper create an efficient and a better tool for marking Attendance in colleges.Please insure that this information stated above is not leaked out and stays with the selector only.Thanks!Aditya Grover
