The mitochondria are round "tube-like" organelles that are surrounded by a double membrane, with the inner membrane being highly folded.  the mitochondria are often referred to as the "powerhouse" of the cell.  the mitochondria releases food energy from food molecules to be used by the cell.  This process is called respiration.  Some cells( muscle cells)  require more energy than other cells and so would have many more mitochondria.

The cell wall is a rigid organelle composed of cellulose and lying just outside the cell membrane.  The cell wall gives the plant cell it's box-like shape.  it also protects the cell.  The cell wall contains pores which allow materials to pass to and from the cell membrane.
